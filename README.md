Thoughtworks Coding Exercise
===============================

Stack:
  1.  language:  Ruby
  2.  test framework:  rSpec


Problem One: Trains
----------------------------

For this exercise I am using an adjacency matrix to record the connections between vertices and the relative weights among them.


Graph Inputs
-----------------

Graph data should be provided in a YAML text file named graph_data.yml.  Use the existing './tests/fixtures/graph_data.yml' file as a model for formatting that data.

Note: the record IDs ("one:, two:, three:,...") are arbitrary and can be any unique value you choose.  The body of each record, however, must be formatted as shown.  Quotes are not required for any values.
