Notes for testing and method creation

• app starts schedule
• app reads input file
• app provides error message if input file not found
• app provides error message if a duplicate route is found
• app creates adjacency matrix
• app creates matrix with 9 rows
• app creates matrix with 9 columns
• app provides error message if matrix is not valid size
• app doesn't allow travel the wrong way
• app has distance of 5 between A and B
• app has distance of 5 between A and D
• app provides error message if matrix values are invalid
• app calculates 9 distance from A-B-C
• app calculates 5 distance from A-D
• app calculates 13 distance from A-D-C
• app calculates 22 distance from A-E-B-C-D
• app calculates NO SUCH ROUTE distance from A-E-D
• app calculates 2 number trips starting and ending at C with max 3 stops
• app calculates 3 number trips starting at A and ending at C with exactly 4 stops
• app calculates 9 as shortest trip from A to C
• app calculates 9 as shortest trip from B to B
• app calculates 7 as number of routes from C to C with distance less than 30


Specified
• app calculates distance along a route
• app calculates shortest distance between two towns
• app calculates all routes between two towns

Expected Output
• app reads input file
• app creates adjacency matrix
• app calculates distance along a route
• app calculates shortest distance between two towns
• app calculates all routes between two towns
• app calculates all routes with max number of stops
• app calculates all routes with exact number of stops
• app returns count of routes between two towns with max stops
• app returns count of routes between two towns with exact stops
• app finds shortest route between two towns
